## Raydoc - AI Context

No more AI hallucinations. Just real answers from your real code.

**Built by Kade Angell & Taylor Rowser**  

AI can be a powerful coding assistantâ€”but only if it understands your code. Too often, AI models **invent missing details**, guessing at types, dependencies, and logic when they donâ€™t have full context. We got tired of jumping between files just to copy everything an AI needed for even simple questions.  

So we built **Raydoc**, a VSCode extension that **automates context gathering** and stops AI from making things up.  

### ðŸš€ How It Works  
- **One Shortcut, Instant Context** â€“ Press `Cmd+Shift+C` (`Ctl+Shift+C` on Windows/Linux) to copy all relevant context for your cursor.  
- **More Than Just Code Snippets** â€“ Includes function definitions, type info, dependencies, and surrounding logic.  
- **Designed for AI** â€“ Gives Large Language Models (LLMs) what they need to generate **accurate, informed responses** instead of wild guesses.  

### ðŸ”¥ Why Use Raydoc?  
âœ… **No More AI Hallucinations** â€“ AI stops fabricating types and functions.  
âœ… **Faster Debugging & Documentation** â€“ Get structured context for smarter AI-generated explanations.  
âœ… **Works Across Languages** â€“ Supports Typescript, Javascript, Go, Python, and C++. Tell us if you need another by [opening an issue](https://github.com/raydoc-dev/raydoc-ai-context/issues/new).
