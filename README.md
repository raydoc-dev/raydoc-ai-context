# Raydoc - AI Context

**Built by Kade Angell & Taylor Rowser**  

Raydoc - AI Context is a VSCode extension that extracts relevant context from your codebase to improve AI-assisted explanations. By providing detailed symbol-specific context, this extension helps Large Language Models (LLMs) better understand your code structure, dependencies, and logic.

## Features

- **Instant Context Extraction** – Press `Cmd+Shift+C` to copy the context for the symbol your cursor is on.
- **Comprehensive Code Insights** – Includes function definitions, type information, imported packages, and file structure.
- **Optimized for AI Integration** – Designed to provide meaningful context for LLMs when answering coding-related questions.

## Installation

1. Open VSCode and navigate to the Extensions Marketplace.
2. Search for **"Raydoc - AI Context"**.
3. Click **Install**.
4. You're ready to start extracting context!

## Usage

1. Place your cursor over a symbol in your code.
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+C` (or `Ctrl+Shift+C` on Windows/Linux).
3. The extracted context will be copied to your clipboard.
4. Paste it into your preferred AI assistant for a more informed response.

## Why Use Raydoc - AI Context?

*   LLMs Need Context – AI models often lack access to the full codebase, making responses less accurate. Raydoc helps bridge this gap.
*   Faster Debugging & Documentation – Easily extract structured context for AI-generated explanations or documentation.
*   Works Across Languages – Supports multiple languages based on VSCode's languageId.
