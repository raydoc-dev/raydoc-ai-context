# **[Feature/Component Name] Design Document**

## **1. Goals**
- **Objective:** What problem is this feature solving?  
- **Expected outcome:** What should success look like?  
- **Key beneficiaries:** Who or what benefits from this? (e.g., end-users, developers, system performance)  
- **Constraints:** Any hard limitations the AI must work within.  

## **2. Current Context**
- **Existing system summary:** What does the current system do?  
- **Pain points/gaps:** Why is this change needed?  
- **High-level impact:** What areas of the codebase are affected?  

## **3. Assumptions & Editable Inputs**
_(These are assumptions the agent makes, which the user can edit to refine the design.)_  
- **Expected use case:** [AI-generated assumption]  
- **System constraints:** [AI-generated assumption]  
- **Technology stack:** [AI-generated assumption]  

## **4. Requirements (Summary)**
_(Detailed requirements are in a separate document.)_  

### **4.1 Functional Requirements**
- Core functionality and expected behaviors.  
- System interactions and dependencies.  

### **4.2 Non-Functional Requirements**
- Performance, scalability, and reliability expectations.  
- Security and observability considerations.  

## **5. Design Strategy**
- **Approach:** The general method for implementing this change.  
- **Trade-offs considered:** Why was this approach chosen over alternatives?  

## **6. Technical Design**
### **6.1 Core Components**
- **Main affected parts of the system.**  
- **Changes to data flow or logic.**  
- **Any dependencies or constraints.**  

### **6.2 Data Design (If Applicable)**
- **Database schema changes.**  
- **Data validation rules.**  
- **Data storage and retrieval strategies.**  

### **6.3 Integration Points (If Applicable)**
- **API changes or external service interactions.**  
- **Error handling and data exchange formats.**  

## **7. Maintainability & Future Considerations**
### **7.1 Suggested Refactors (If Necessary)**
- **Refactoring should only be done if required for functionality.**  
- **Potential improvements to structure or efficiency.**  

### **7.2 Future-Proofing**
- **Scalability and long-term maintainability considerations.**  

## **8. Implementation Roadmap**
_(High-level execution steps—no strict timelines.)_  
1. **Phase 1** – Initial implementation  
2. **Phase 2** – Enhancements & refinements  
3. **Phase 3** – Production readiness  

## **9. Testing Strategy**
- **Unit tests:** Key scenarios to validate.  
- **Integration tests:** Expected behavior across system interactions.  
- **Mocking and validation approach.**  

## **10. Observability & Monitoring (If Applicable)**
- **Logging strategy:** Key log points.  
- **Metrics to track:** Performance, errors, health indicators.
- Specifically focus on tracking changes or potential effects of changes.

## **11. Dependencies**
- **Runtime:** Required libraries, external services.  
- **Development:** Build tools, testing frameworks.  

## **12. Security Considerations**
- **Authentication, authorization, and data protection.**
- Specifically focused on the implications of any changes.

## **13. Rollout Strategy**
- **Development → Testing → Deployment → Monitoring.**
- Based on project/organization plan or industry best practices.

## **15. References**
- **Related design docs, API specs, or external documentation.**
